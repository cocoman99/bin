## bin repo
That repository can contain files that are uncompleted or have bugs. I have created it (and this README too) for learning, testing purposes and playing with code. This is "working" repo. Enjoy but at your own risk, ha !

## Plan is to play with:
- Structures
- Enums
- Ownership system
- Common collections
- Handling errors
- and what next? We will see...
